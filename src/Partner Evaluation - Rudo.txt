	Arnav and I were great parteners for the project. I worked a lot on the back-end processing code
while he spent a lot of time creating a GUI and launcher. We both were able to help each other and were 
extremely effecient in our time well spent and coding. I mainly worked on the methods used for the text
version of the game with move(), init(), and start() generating proper game boards. Arnav spent majority
of his time on the GUI setting up pixel measurements and icons to make the game look nice.
