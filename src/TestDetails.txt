For the terminal version of the game, we tested primarily using the move() method. We used a driver class to facilitate this process. Mainly, we tried colliding trucks and cars, and tried sending each type of vehicle out of the board to make sure that collision detection and valid move detection were working. For the graphical version, we did something similar, making each type of vehicle collide both vertically and horizontally, and trying to send the vehicles out of the board.
