David and I worked together extensively on this project. We created a GitHub repository so we could collaborate, and used that whenever we couldn't talk face to face. We had 2 versions; the bare-bones terminal one, and the full graphic one. We both contributed equally to the terminal version, with David making the initialization method, and me making the move method. We decided to branch on the graphical version, and design 2 different graphical interfaces. Eventually, we decided to use my graphical interface.
